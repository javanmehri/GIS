# Spectral Enhancement

In this lesson you will:
- Open an image file and choose a default enhancement.
- Use the toolbar enhancement commands.
- Adjust toolbar enhancements.
- Adjust the image contrast and brightness.
- Enhance images from the shortcut menu.

To begin, you will open an image file and remove the default enhancement so that you can view the original unenhanced radar image. Then, you will select an enhancement and see how to choose the default enhancement that best suits your needs.

##### To begin this exercise, make sure Focus is running.

##### Open the radarsat.pix database from your mod03 folder
